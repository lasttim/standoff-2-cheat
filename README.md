## About

Dumped code of the program to hacking standoff 2 game to PC

## What is there and what is missing in the code?

There are a couple of shortcomings:
1. No icons.
2. There's a lot of broken code
3. Not working functionality (needs to be updated or finalized)

On the plus side:
1. Working authorization system based on keyauth
2. There is a menu with loader and prescribed buttons
